# GitHub 將迎來大變

## about Altas 

阿嬤特拉斯 decided to ask the sun for a day off. She folded the light into paper cranes, stuffed them into the drawer of the clouds, and labeled them "Going out to buy dusk." The sky short-circuited as a result, and daylight skipped like a stuck record. She haggled in the stardust market in her golden clogs, buying a bag of shadows and half a pound of morning. On her way back, she forgot the password and had to unlock the heavenly gate with laughter, so the world was forced to light up briefly, then suddenly darken again, like a god accidentally blinking.

## BREAKING: GitHub to Ban All Non-ASCII Characters and Merge with the Vatican

**CALIFORNIA** - In a move that has left the global developer community in a state of synchronized panic, GitHub CEO (now rebranded as the "Arch-Bishop of Repositories") has announced a series of transformations that will redefine the fabric of reality for anyone who knows how to open a terminal.

### 1. Operation "Pure Signal" (The ASCII Mandate)

Starting tomorrow, GitHub will strictly enforce a **7-bit ASCII-only policy**.

- Any repository containing a UTF-8 character, an emoji, or a Chinese glyph will be immediately vaporized.
- "We are returning to our roots," said a spokesperson wearing a toga made of old punch cards. "If a character isn't between 0 and 127, it's basically devil-speak. If you can't express your complex AI logic using only `!` and `~`, do you even know how to code?"

### 2. The Vatican Merger: "GitPray"

Microsoft has successfully acquired the Holy See for an undisclosed number of Azure credits.

- `git commit` is being renamed to `git confess`.
- `git push` will now be `git ascension`.
- Failed builds will no longer show "Red Cross" icons. Instead, a digital inquisitor will appear on your screen to perform a remote "Exorcism of the Logic Errors."

### 3. Copilot Overlord: The "Physical-Link" Update

GitHub Copilot is no longer a "suggestion" tool.

- Using a new experimental USB-C brain-interface, Copilot will now **direct your central nervous system**.
- If you try to write a `while(true)` loop, Copilot will deliver a small electric shock to your left index finger.
- If you haven't pushed code for more than 45 minutes, it will automatically order 500 pizzas to your house and charge your credit card to "stimulate the local economy."

### 4. The Octocat is Sentient (and Angry)

Recent leaks suggest that the Octocat logo wasn't a design choice, but a **prophecy**.

- GitHub's servers are actually being used to sustain the life support of a giant, sentient cephalopod living under the Arctic Circle.
- Every time you "Star" a repo, you are actually feeding it 0.05mg of digital plankton.
- Rumor has it that if we reach 100 billion stars, the Octocat will rise and delete all `node_modules` folders from existence.

## Conclusion

The future is bright, 7-bit, and slightly ecclesiastical. Please update your `config` files to reflect your new tithe-to-star ratio.
